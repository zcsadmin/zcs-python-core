# Local development

## Run library tests

If you want to run library tests against your local docker development environment, you can run:

```bash
./run.sh -t
```

## Run tests in a dist docker image

To be sure that anything is going the right way, you can run the library tests against a dist docker image. This will assure that anything is working properly in a fresh installed environment.

```bash
./run.sh -i
```

## Other commands and help

```bash
./run.sh -h
```
